This workshop is organized by Dr. Alessandra Vigilante for the the "<a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/study/doctoral-studies/health-sciences-doctoral-training-centre/enabling-the-big-data-revolution-through-skills-training/">Innovation Scholars Programme: Big Data Skills Training</a>" at King's College London. 
  
This workshop is a Data Carpentry workshop.
Data Carpentry develops and teaches workshops on the fundamental data skills needed to conduct
  research. Its target audience is researchers who have little to no prior computational experience, 
  and its lessons are domain specific, building on learners' existing knowledge to enable them to quickly 
  apply skills learned to their own research. Participants will be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.
